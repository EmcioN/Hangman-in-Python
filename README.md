## Credits
[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) was also very helpful. There you can find a solution with an explanation to most problems.

[W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) is another place where I was looking for information. Everything is nicely explained and you can test it yourself.

Of course, the greatest support I received was from my mentor. Many thanks to him.
